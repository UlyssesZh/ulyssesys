# ulyssesys

A minimalist and informative zsh theme based on [ys](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/ys.zsh-theme).

## Features

- Only ANSI colors and ASCII chars are used, so that this theme is suitable for both graphical terminal emulators
and virtual terminals (text TTY).
- The colors are designed so that this theme can be used with both light and dark backgrounds.
- Shows command index, full path to the current directory, exit code of last command, and current Git branch,
in a non-cluttering way.
